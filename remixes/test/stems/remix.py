"""STEMS -- STEM REC on the stock effects.

Every track to the card while the sequencer plays, one file each; UP +
REC opens STEMS (docs/firmware/STEM_REC.md). No octabam DSP: the 14 stock
effects are listed so the FX2 chooser is stock's. STEMS1 listed STEM REC
alone and drew a one-row chooser with nothing in it (Yves's MKII, 30 Sep
2026); ok-ms lists them for the same reason. No MAIN MENU row so BRAIN
can own the root's fifth category.
