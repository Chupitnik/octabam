"""stations-fx2 -- SPECTRUM, CHARACTER and MODULATION live on FX1 and FX2.

Each station's SLOTS build setting pinned to FX1+FX2 (tools/remix/stations.py):
an FX2 instance runs the station instead of passing dry. The fixture of
tools/verify/verify_stations_fx2.py. Stock DELAY is listed; every other stock
effect gives up its words. No bus: fallback NONE, no SEND.
