"""REPITCH_REPEAT98_KYOTI -- TSTR RPCH / RPS9 / RPSP: tempo-locked varispeed with S900/S950 and SP-1200 repitch emulations, and QUAN ratios on PTCH.

Source: `upstream/` is Zac Kyoti's repository (Zac-Kyoti/octatrack-kyoti-fw,
submodule, fork `sambanks/octatrack-kyoti-fw`, pinned to `bf5bfc0`). The declaration is
`upstream/octabam-modules/repitch-repeat98-kyoti/manifest.py`: three DRAM units
(`patch_repitch_kyoti.s`, `rpk_glyphs.s`, `patch_repitch_reload.s`), the first
two re-linked and compared with the author's own bytes (`reference`) every
build, and a DSP section (`rpk_dsp.asm`, reached by two hooks -- the voice
kernel's prologue and the boot memory clear -- with two table blocks). Its source paths are derived from its own directory, so it is executed
here from the source on disk, as the registry does for every manifest, and this
file only re-exports its MODULE. Nothing inside `upstream/` is edited here.
