"""MEMORY -- the platform's reserve in stock's audio page arena, sized per
remix from what its modules claim.

Every remix with a DRAM unit carries it (tools/remix/registry.remix
appends it). It has no code. The build (tools/build/build_bus.py, the
MEMORY section) sizes the reserve, octabam's platform pages at the
bottom of the arena (tools/remix/arena.py):
  - the linked runtime of every `dram=True` unit, its packed loader stage
    and its .bss (a sizing link at the largest reserve finds the top);
  - every DramRegion, stacked down from the reserve's ceiling;
  - every ArenaReserve, a fixed-address claim the reserve reaches past
    (REMIX SWITCH's image stage, Analog BD's pre-boot upload scratch).
The build report prints the per-module table and the pages left for
samples and recorders. The ledger refuses declared claims past the floor
(arena.MIN_PAGES_LEFT pages stay), two overlapping fixed claims, and a
fixed claim in a remix with no DRAM unit. A module that declares a
DramRegion or an ArenaReserve requires MEMORY.

Until 11 Oct 2026 the reserve was a fixed 1,707 pages (10 MiB) in every
remix with a DRAM unit.
