# `sidechain-compressor` -- SIDECHAIN_COMPRESSOR

Stock COMPRESSOR with a side-chain KEY: any of T1-T8 can drive its detector. Page 2 adds KEY (OFF or T1-T8), KFLT (the key's filter: 64 bypass, below low-pass, above high-pass), KGN (the key's gain, about -24..+24 dB) and MON (hear the processed key instead), beside stock's RMS.

Built from [Zac-Kyoti/octatrack-kyoti-fw](https://github.com/Zac-Kyoti/octatrack-kyoti-fw)
(submodule `upstream/`, fork `sambanks/octatrack-kyoti-fw`, pinned to `bf5bfc0`). `Kind.DSP_EFFECT` with `MenuEntry(replaces="COMPRESSOR", stock_dsp=True)`: the row is COMPRESSOR's and its dispatch entry stays stock's. One linked unit (`patch_sidechain.s`, 338 B; ROM cave or DRAM by the `PLACE` setting, default CAVE: KEY's and KFLT's formatters, KEY's list widget, and `sc_norm`, reached by two `jsr` detours at the first instruction of both page-2 copiers, `0x4000cae8` and its twin `0x40003d1c`: a COMPRESSOR saved on stock firmware, whose hidden slots 8-11 hold stock's defaults `0x7f/0/0/0`, comes up with KEY OFF, KFLT and KGN centred and MON OFF); page-2 slots 8-11 as raw descriptor words; three per-payload `DspHook`s (`sctap`, `scdet`, `moncommit`); the per-core values as `DspSection.subst`; the 48 table words as one `ptable`.
`upstream/octabam-modules/sidechain-compressor/README.md` is the full description, with what was measured and what was inferred.

## Measured

- Every build re-links `sc_cf` and compares it with the author's own bytes (`reference`); a difference refuses the build.
- The cloned COMPRESSOR descriptor equals the author's standalone image's, except the three words that point into `sc_cf`.
- On both payloads the placed DSP code is the standalone's instruction for instruction, except the two table loads (the KEY FLT load is `lua (r1+$10),r1` + `nop` from the one `ptable` base); the 48 table words are identical.
- `make check REMIX=sidechain-compressor` (`remixes/test/sidechain-compressor/`) and `make check REMIX=kyoti-mute-sidechain` build and boot the image under the ColdFire port.

## On the unit

- 4 Oct 2026, on the author's MKI, in an octabam image with all six KYOTI modules, REC_TRIG_MUTE and this module: COMPRESSOR's two pages; KEY ducking on one core and across cores both ways (T1 to T5, T5 to T1); KFLT, KGN and MON; no reverb cross-talk with DARK or PLATE REV on T7; a muted KEY in every MUTE MODE, and the first kick after PLAY with it muted.
- Before that: the author's standalone image and the KYOTI V1.0 combined image, on the author's MKI: KEY ducking, MON, a muted KEY with MUTE MODE.

## Notes

- Its DSP section needs donor words: the test remixes give up SPRING REV, as the standalone build does.
- Not with BusDelay or BusVerb: its keybus (core-private `Y:$7f0-$9ff`) and cross-core window (the last `$202` words of each core's half of the shared window) overlap theirs, and the ledger refuses the pair. A later version is planned to move both.
