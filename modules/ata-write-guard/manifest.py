"""ATA WRITE GUARD: keep stock's initial PIO write critical section intact
until its buffer pointer and remaining-sector count describe the sent data.

The stock routine masks interrupts for the command store, restores SR at
0x40014cf2, sends the first sector, then updates its globals. A task switch
after the final data word can let the completion interrupt see the old
count and poll DRQ forever. Measured under the port.
